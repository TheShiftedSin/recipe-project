    <img src="burek.jpg">
  <p>One of the best eastern European dishes youll ever find; Loved by millions across the world.</p> 
    <p> Personally, I think if i were forced to eat this my entire life, i would never get tired of it. Its a delicious dish filled with whatever you want it to be,though is usually either ground beef, spinach, or egg and yogurt.</p>
  <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon  ground allspice</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
      <li>1 medium potato, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
      <li>16 sheets phyllo dough, thawed</li>
      <li> 1/4 cup of melted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps to cooking it</h2>
    <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 400° F(200°C)</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
    <p>Cook and stir ground beef in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain fat. Stir in allspice, paprika, salt, and pepper. Transfer mixture to a large bowl and stir in potato and onion.</p>
 <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
    <p>Stack two sheets phyllo dough on a work surface. Spoon 1/8 of the beef mixture down one long edge of the stack, then roll phyllo around filling into a tube. Coil the tube into a snail shape and place onto an ungreased baking sheet. Repeat to make seven more burek, placing finished coils up against one another to keep them from unrolling. Brush melted butter over the tops.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.</p>
