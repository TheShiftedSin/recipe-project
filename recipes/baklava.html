    <p>This baklava recipe is simple and easy. Transfer the baklava slices into cupcake papers for easy serving. These pastries freeze well, too.</p>
  <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound chopped nuts</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough</li>
      <li>1 cup butter, melted</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>1/2 cup of honey</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li> 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps to cooking it</h2>
    <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
    <p>Toss together nuts and cinnamon. Unroll phyllo and cut the whole stack in half to fit the dish. Cover phyllo with a damp cloth while assembling the baklava, to keep it from drying out.</p>
 <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
    <p>Place 2 sheets of phyllo in the bottom of the prepared dish. Brush generously with some of the melted butter. Sprinkle 2 to 3 tablespoons of the nut mixture on top. Repeat layers until all ingredients are used, ending with about 6 sheets of phyllo.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
    <p>Using a sharp knife, cut baklava into 4 long rows, then diagonally 9 times to make 36 diamond shapes. Be sure to cut all the way through to the bottom of the layers.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and crisp, about 50 minutes. While baklava is baking, combine sugar and water in a small saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Stir in honey, vanilla, and lemon zest; reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>
    <p>Remove baklava from the oven and immediately spoon syrup over it. Let cool completely before serving. Store uncovered.</p>
