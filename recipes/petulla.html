    <h1> Petulla </h1>
    <img src="petulla.jpg">
    <p> One of the best morning dishes honestly. Petulla tastes amazing by itself, but when you add some honey to it, it feels like heaven. You can eat a lot of these too without feeling too full.</p>
  <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups Unbleached Organic Bread Flour</li>
      <li>3 Eggs</li>
      <li>1 1/2 Cups Greek Yogurt</li>
      <li>1 Tablespoon baking soda</li>
      <li>0.5 Tablespoon Meditteranean sea salt</li>
      <li>1 Tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>Oil for frying – I prefer using grapeseed oil however that is not authentic, so if you’re looking for traditional use vegetable oil for frying.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps to cooking it</h2>
    <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
    <p>Sift the flour if needed, add salt and baking soda, mix and set dry ingredients aside.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
    <p>Whisk eggs, add yogurt and keep whisking. Add olive oil and mix.</p>
 <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
    <p>Finally start adding the dry ingredients slowly to bowl and incorporate with the eggs/yogurt mix.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
    <p>Cover the dough with a kitchen towel, let it rest in the refrigerator overnight. Next morning take bowl out and let is sit in room temperature.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
    <p>Once dough is bubbly, you can fry it in oil. Make sure to flip the dough so it fries evenly on all sides. Petullas need to look golden brown.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>
    <p>It’s important to let the fried dough rest on a platter with paper towel before serving. This step will ensure that the dough doesn’t keep the oil it has absorbed during frying process.</p>
